# Trace an Object With Acceleration Data
This project which contains a Android application and a Java desktop application aims to estimate object position with using accelerometer data and camera.<br>

# Sensor Camera Application - Android
This Android application is designed to capture video and accelerometer data frame by frame.<br>
Sensor Camera app records video and accelerometer data simultaneously, accelerometer data will be saved in a .txt file.<br>
To record sensor data go settings and check "Ä°vme Verisini Kaydet" radio button. <br>
Both sensor data and video will be saved DCIM/SensorKamera directory.<br>

# Acceleration Estimation Application - Java Desktop
This Java desktop application is designed to estimate position of an object with using video file and accelerometer data file captured with Sensor Camera app in Android.<br>
Copy video file and accelerometer data file with same name to your computer, then in application, specify alpha value and video file path with extension.<br>
